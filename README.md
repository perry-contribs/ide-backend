# Coding Blocks IDE Backend
Backend app for Coding Blocks IDE

### Steps to run locally

Please ensure you have the following installed:


[node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/")

[npm]("https://www.npmjs.com/")

[postgres]("https://www.postgresql.org/")

Install project dependencies:

````
npm install
````

You'll now have to setup a blank database and credentials in Postgres. The database will be configured by the schema automatically. If you're not familiar with this, please use the "Further Reading" section.

Inside the folder ````util````, copy the contents of ````environment.sh.example ```` into a new file named ````environment.sh````. Modify the contents of this file as per the credentials and database name you setup in postgres.

````
npm start
````
